\title{Function to produce a bar or violin plot of an individual community.}
\usage{
plotCommunity(counts, type = "bar", xlabels = NULL, xcols = NULL,
  res = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A count table in which the rows are strains or OTUs and the columns are samples. The table should include only a single sample group.}

\item{type}{Determines the plot style, either 'bar' or 'violin'.}

\item{xlabels}{An optional vector of strain names, the default is to use the row names of the count table.}

\item{xcols}{An optional vector of strain colours, the default is to use rainbow().}

\item{res}{The resolution of the histograms used to create the violins for that plot style.}
}
\value{
A list of the statistics for each strain as generated by boxplot().
}
\description{
Function to produce a bar or violin plot of an individual community.
}
\details{
For each strain, samples in which they were not observed are counted and separated from the main bar or violin.
As a result, the number of samples in each bar or violin varies, and the histogram for each violin is therefore normalised.
